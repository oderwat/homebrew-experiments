#Homebrew-Experiments

Some (experimental) homebrew formulas I made to keep my workflows clean!

To use it just add them to your homebrew-formulas with:

`brew tap oderwat/homebrew-experiments`

To remove my experimental Formulars from Homebrew just untap them

`brew untap oderwat/homebrew-experiments`

To list all your taps you can list them with

`brew tap`

After you added the formulars to you can simply brew all of them as usual (e.g.):

`brew install rngtest`

`brew install --HEAD rngtest`

If you want to get rid of them you can simply uninstall them:

`brew uninstall rngtest`

# Available Formulars

_Important: I usually fork the original package so that the formular does not get invalid if they get modified or deleted._

## rngtest

This is rngtest from the linux package rng-tools modified for compilation on mac os x.
